# Hi, welcome to Pedro Lucas Caratti Git ðŸ‘‹

## About me
ðŸ“Œ My name is Pedro Lucas Caratti. I am a 22-year-old Software Developer based in Primavera do Leste, Mato Grosso, Brazil.

ðŸ“š I am currently a student at **IFMT - Campus Primavera do Leste**, a prestigious federal institution. I am pursuing a course in **Systems Development and Analysis Technology (TADS)**.

ðŸ’¬ My coding journey began when I was just 12 years old, inspired by my father, a seasoned Senior Developer with over 32 years of experience. I started off with **Python**, with the goal of following in his footsteps.

Although my GitHub profile may not display an extensive list of projects, I've had the privilege of working on a mobile app called SpeedCode at Speed System Software House. This project allowed me to face a multitude of challenges and grow as a developer. When I began in 2015, I was using **Java Android Native**, which I later migrated to **Kotlin** in 2017. Eventually, in 2019, I redesigned it in **Flutter**, and I have been using **Flutter and Dart** ever since.

This journey has shaped me into the developer I am today, and I look forward to contributing more to the open-source community.
