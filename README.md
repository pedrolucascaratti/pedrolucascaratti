# Hi, welcome to Pedro Lucas Caratti Git ðŸ‘‹

## About me
My name is Pedro Lucas Caratti, I'm 22 yr old and I live in Primavera do Leste - Mato Grosso - Brazil.  

I'm currently studying on **IFMT - Campus Primavera do Leste**, my course is **TADS - Systems Development and Analysis Technology**.  

I have started to code when 12 yr old with python, having my father as inspiration, he is a Senior Dev with 32 years experience (Actual Harbour Dev).

I don't have much projects on GitHub because in the most time I was developing a mobile app named **SpeedCode** in _Speed System Software House_, in the proccess of developing this app I encountered a lot of challenges, when I started it was **Java Android Native**, a little time later I migrated to **Kotlin**, and a lot of time later I redesingned it in **Flutter**
